## Introduction

The datasets `gaugedSites` contains candidate thresholds that can be used for performing Peaks Over Threshold (POT) analysis. 
This document explained how they were obtained.

## Description

The script `autopot_script.R` is used to find candidate thresholds for the 1114 stations in the datasets.
The computing is done in parallel for multiple sites using the function `FitPot` of the R-package `CSHShydRology`.

For each site, summary graphics are saved in the CACHE folder, which shows the evolution of the p-value of the Anderson-Darling (AD) test, the mean residual life (MRL), the shape parameter of the generalized Pareto distribution and the 10-year flood quantiles.
Figure 1 shows an example of such a summary graph.

The candidate thresholds are sought among all observed values. 
A smooth estimation of the number of peaks per year (PPY) is obtained using isotonic regression due to fluctuations in the PPY as the threshold increase. 
This behaviour is created by the nature of the declustering method.

The automatic threshold (solid red line) is obtained as the first threshold with `PPY <= 2.5` and `AD > 0.25`. 
If none of the candidates respect such criterion, the threshold with the maximum AD is used instead.
This threshold is found in `gaugedSites` under the column `auto`

The table below indicates the proportions of thresholds found by PPY and super regions.
Some super regions have a higher percentage of sites where the automatic threshold was selected below 1.5 PPY, which can be explained by a flood regime that is dominated by spring freshets.
For these sites, the flood frequency analysis would likely be more accurate using the annual maximum approach. 


##### Table 1: Proportion of PPY by super regions.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(floodnetRfa))
ppy.id <- which(substr(names(gaugedSites), 1,3) == 'ppy')
x <- apply(gaugedSites[, ppy.id], 2, '<=', gaugedSites$auto)

ppy <- apply(x, 1, sum)
ppy <- cut(ppy, c(0,2,4,6,7))
ppy <- factor(ppy, labels = c('[2.5,2.0]','(2,1.5]', '(1.5,1]', '(1,0]'))

Fun <- function(z){ 
    z <- as.vector(table(z))
    round(100*z/ sum(z),1)
}

lst <- tapply(ppy, gaugedSites$supreg_km6, Fun)
xt <- do.call(rbind,lst)
colnames(xt) <- levels(ppy)
xt
```

## Super regions

The results are reported by super regions, which represent larger groups of stations with similar characteristics.
The descriptor space locates the stations in terms of its drainage area (AREA) and Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP).  

* Super region 1 are stations found mainly in the northern part of Canada. 
 The basins are generally large with few annual precipitations.

* Super region 2 are stations found mainly on the Pacific coast and the Fraser Valley.  
 The basins have important annual precipitation.

* Super region 3 are stations found mainly in the Prairies and the mountains of British Columbia. 
 The basins are generally small with few annual precipitations.

* Super region 4 are stations found mainly in the north of the Canadian western provinces.
  The basins are generally large with important annual precipitations.  
  
* Super region 5 are stations found mainly in Southern Ontario.
  The basins are generally small with important annual precipitations.
  
* Super region 6 are stations found mainly in the eastern part of Canada.
  The basins generally have important annual precipitations.
